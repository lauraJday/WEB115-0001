Final Project
Reflection Document


This project was very helpful because it allowed us to create a web page 
that is well-organized and productive for most users. The detailed 
instructions were useful but sometimes challenging, as they required 
careful attention to meet all requirements.

To make the large amount of code easier to manage, I moved the style 
elements into a separate CSS file. This approach felt cleaner and more 
organized. Later, I combined the HTML and CSS files for simplicity.

At first, I struggled with the date requirement, but once I realized that 
'Date' is a built-in JavaScript object, it became easier to understand 
how to use it. I worked with methods such as .getFullYear(), which returns 
the four-digit year; .getMonth(), which returns the month (0â€“11); and 
.getDate(), which returns the day of the month. Properly formatting the 
code also helped a lot.

To generate a unique ID for each user, I created another Date object. 
Using Date.now() gave me the current date in milliseconds. I then used 
Math.random() to produce a decimal number between 0 and 1 and multiplied 
it by 1000 to get a whole number.

Overall, the practical nature of building the website and practicing with 
common JavaScript objects were the most helpful and interesting parts of 
this project.
